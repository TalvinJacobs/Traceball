## 'TraceBall'

### I. Initiative
Set inside a browser window, the user controls a small box connected to the mouse and has to escape (not have his box touched by) an enemy box controlled by an AI. The user has three lives (a life is lost once the enemy box touches the users box) and their objective is to last as long as they can.

 - The user has to control his box by using the mouse only
 - The enemy is controlled by an AI which uses math functions (trigonometry) to work out the player's position
 - The game takes place inside a canvas 
 - The user has three lives. They lose a life if the enemy box touches the user's box. If they lose all of their lives, the user loses the game
